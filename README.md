# Data Wrangling of French Higher Education Theses

In this project, we are going to go through an
analysis that was done over a real-life dataset
of Ph.D. theses that were defended in France
between the years 1971 and 2020, and we are
going through all the steps of a data wrangling
project starting with Web scraping the data from
the internet, Data preprocessing, Data Cleaning,
Spotting abnormalities and outliers in the data,
and finally, we will draw assumptions using Data
visualization and some statistical methods.
